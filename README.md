I created this project to deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and other Java concepts. The system serves as a comprehensive tool for managing email accounts within an organization, providing functionalities such as account creation, password management, inbox configuration, and more. This project taught me valuable insights into software design and development practices.
